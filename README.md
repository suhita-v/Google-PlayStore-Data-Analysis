<h2>➤ Steps Involved</h2>
<p>
      <h3>Data Cleaning and Transforming</h3>
    To prepare the data for analysis, we performed several data cleaning steps. First, we checked for null values to ensure that there were no missing pieces of data. We also identified and removed outliers, especially in cases where ratings had a specific range. If null values existed and needed to be replaced with some value, we inserted values using the modeValue method. We modified data values, for size column we removed symbols like K and M and replaced them with their respective values, as well as removed unwanted characters like "+" and ",". We changed data types of columns to ensure that the data was in a format that was easy to analyze. Finally, we dropped duplicates and checked unique values to ensure the integrity of the data and that it was compliant with the intended datatype. A new column 'Revenue' was added by multiplying the prices and installs value for each record.
      <h3>Sentiment analysis using Natural Langugage Processing</h3>
    We performed sentiment analysis on Google Play Store reviews using NLP and TextBlob.The analysis is based on three metrics: polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment.  The polarity column indicates the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral. The subjectivity column measures the degree of personal opinion in the review on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 represents a factual statement and 1 represents a highly opinionated statement. The sentiment column is an aggregate score between -1 and 1 that takes into account both polarity and subjectivity. A score of -1 indicates an extremely negative review, 1 indicates an extremely positive review, and 0 indicates a neutral review. These insights can be useful for improving product quality and customer satisfaction.<br>
      <h3>Insights using MySQL</h3>
       A schema was created having both the datasets to answer the problem statements through queries in MySQL Workbench. <br>
      https://github.com/Kaushaldev15/Google-PlayStore-Data-Analysis/blob/0e614886439d46e475c99863c96b3 <br>
      
<br> • Problem Statements-
<p>
  1. Total number of apps present in the Google playstore dataset. <br>
  2. Number of Categories present in the dataset.<br>
  3. All categories with the number of apps in them.<br>
  4. Average rating and average size of all the apps.<br>
  5. Overview of all categories wrt Number of installs, least rated app, highest rated app, number of free apps and number of paid apps in that category in that category.<br>
  6. Which are the top 10 highest rated apps in the given available dataset?<br>

  8. Which app has the highest number of reviews? Also, mention the number of reviews and category of the app.<br>
  9. What is the total amount of revenue generated by the google play store by hosting apps? (Whenever a user buys apps  from the google play store, the amount is considered in the revenue)<br>
  10. Which Category of google play store apps has the highest number of installs? Also, find out the total number of installs for that particular category.<br>
  11. Which Genre has the most number of published apps?<br>
  12. Find the count of apps in each content rating based on App type.<br>
  13. Create a new column to bucket rating to high(4-5), medium(2-4), low(0-2). Return the app names.<br>
  14. Return categories with their sentiment counts for each type of sentiment.<br>

       <h3>Data Visualization</h3>
      Visualization was done in: <br>
      • Python- using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries in Google collab: <br> https://github.com/Kaushaldev15/Google-PlayStore-Data-Analysis/blob/0e614886439d46e475c99863c96b3e475793662a/Google_Playstore_DataAnalysis.ipynb <br>
      
   <br>  • Power BI- Major part of visualization was done here after loading the cleaned datasets.<br>
      https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiODMwYzNkN2ItYmZhZi00MjNmLTg4YTMtNDM3ZWZmNTRlMzg2IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9 <br>
        Please refer to PowerBI Reports.pdf for python visualisations on the 4th page: <br>
https://github.com/Kaushaldev15/Google-PlayStore-Data-Analysis/blob/0e614886439d46e475c99863c96b3e475793662a/PowerBI%20Reports.pdf <br>
      
<br> Here, we divided our analysis into 3 parts: <br>
      - Category wise analysis: Top categories, Content rating distribution, Average rating of categories, Revenue, Average app size per category, Sentiment distribution across all categories.<br>
      - Applications wise analysis: An overview of all applications with different parameters, Bar plots for Installs, Ratings, Revenue, Reviews and Size. <br>
      - Sentiment analysis of user reviews: Sentiment count by category, Top 5 most positively and negatively reviewed categories and Subjectivity distribution across categories: <br>
      0-0.25 ~ Factual opinion <br>
      0.25-0.5 ~ Moderately factual <br>
      0.5-0.75 ~ Moderately personal <br>
      0.75-1 ~ Personal opinion <br>
      
</p>
      
<h2>➤ Challenges Faced</h2>
<p> 
  • The Amount of Null values in the dataset were very high and had to be dropped while cleaning which took out almost 13.75% of the dataset, the integrity of the dataset was weak which lead to dropping 1491 rows just to remove Null values. <br>
    
    
  • The combined dataset after joining in SQL of both Playstore Apps and user reviews had only 500 apps in common, which accounts for merely 6.1 % of the total cleaned data. With a larger overlap of around 70% - 80% between the datasets, we could have derived more meaningful insights and conducted more valuable analysis. <br>
    
    
  • Many of the applications had their names containing only symbols and invalid characters, we found that those applications didn’t exist on the Google Playstore so we these applications had to be removed from the analysis. <br>
</p>
